BACKGROUNDS
===========

The background of Rotix is a newsgroup where people liked to make jokes with
rot-xx obfuscations. At one point translating it by hand became to much of a
bother and I wrote rot, to do this for me.

rot was kind of a personal project and very primitive. I didn't bother much
for an interface, since I was the only person to use it. rot was a very
handy tool, but if I wanted to translate more than one line of text, it
would become annoying. So a new version was due.

At that time I was getting interested in Open-Source Software and in
releasing software. I wanted to do something back to the community who gave
me so much. Of course the project had to have a name: Rotix, derived from
the Dutch pronunciation of ROT-x. Rotix 0.7 was the result of this.


WEBSITE
=======

Of course Rotix has a website. You may even have downloaded this package
from it. The website contains an HTML-version of the Rotix man-page and some
of the cryptographic theories behind Rotix. The address is:
